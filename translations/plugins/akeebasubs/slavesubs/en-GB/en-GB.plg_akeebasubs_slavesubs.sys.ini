PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SLAVESUBS="Akeeba Subscriptions - Slave subscriptions support"
PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SLAVESUBS_DESCRIPTION="When a user subscribers he can choose up to ten different existing users who will also get the same subscription he subscribes into. Those extra subscriptions are called slaves. The changes to this user's subscription will be automatically applied to the slave subscriptions. The limits of slave subscriptions is defined per subscription level for maximum flexibility. This allows you to implement something like 'family subscriptions' which allow several members of the same family to share a single subscription, without having to subscribe each family member individually."
