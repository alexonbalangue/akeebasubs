;; [CUSTOM:YourFieldName]	Where yourFieldName is the name of a custom field in all uppercase letters. Custom fields can be defined in plugins. If you have created any custom field plugins, you know what this is. If you don't know what this is, you most likely don't need it!
;;
;; You can override this file by creating a file in the
;; administrator/languages/en-GB directory named
;; en-GB.plg_akeebasubs_subscriptionemails.override.ini with your customized
;; email messages. You can override one or several email messages.
;;
;; TIP: If you don't want one of those emails to be sent at all, use the language
;; override file to set its head or body text to an empty string. For example, in
;; order to disable the emails when a payment gets cancelled by the payment processor,
;; set this
;; PLG_AKEEBASUBS_SUBSCRIPTIONEMAILS_HEAD_CANCELLED_NEW=""
;; and this plugin will skip those emails.
